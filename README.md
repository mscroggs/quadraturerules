# Quadrature rules

[The online encylopedia of quadrature rules](https://quadraturerules.org) is a reference website that lists a number of quadrature rules.

Quadrature rules are sets of points and weights that are used to approximate integrals. If $$\{p_0,\dots,p_{n-1}\}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\{w_0,\dots,w_{n-1}\}\subset\mathbb{R}$
are the points and weights (repectively) of the quadrature rule for a single integral, then:

$$\int f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x \approx \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f(p_i)w_i$$
