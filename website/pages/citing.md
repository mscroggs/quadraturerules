On each quadrature rule's page, you can find citations for the paper(s) that introduced
that rule. These papers should be cited when using a given rule. If you wish to cite this
website itself, you can use the following BibTeX:

```
@misc{quadraturerules.org,
       AUTHOR = {{{list contributors|bibtex}}},
        TITLE = {The online encyclopedia of quadrature rules},
         YEAR = {{{{date:Y}}}},
 HOWPUBLISHED = {\url{https://quadraturerules.org}},
         NOTE = {[Online; accessed {{date:D-M-Y}}]}
}
```

<ul class='citations'>
<li>{{list contributors|citation}}. <i>The online encyclopedia of quadrature rules</i>, {{date:Y}}, <a href='https://quadraturerules.org'>https://quadraturerules.org</a> [Online; accessed: {{date:D-M-Y}}].</li>
