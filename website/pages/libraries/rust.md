# Rust library

The quadraturerules Rust library is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/quadraturerules).
It can be installed by running:

```bash
cargo install quadraturerules
```

To use the latest version of quadraturerules in your crate, add the following to the
`[dependencies]` section of your Cargo.toml file:

```toml
quadraturerules = "{{VERSION}}"
```

## Usage

The library's function `single_integral_quadrature` can be used to get the points and weights
of quadrature rules for a single integral. For example the following snippet will create an
order 3 Xiao--Gimbutas rule on a triangle:

```rust
use quadraturerules::{Domain, QuadratureRule, single_integral_quadrature};

let (points, weights) = single_integral_quadrature(
    QuadratureRule::XiaoGimbutas,
    Domain::Triangle,
    3,
).unwrap();
```

Note that the points returned by the library are represented using
[barycentric coordinates](/barycentric.md).

## Generating the library
The Rust quadraturerules library can be generated from the templates in the online encyclopedia
of quadrature rules GitHub repo. First clone the repo and move into the library directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quadraturerules/quadraturerules.git
cd quadraturerules/library
```

The Rust library can then be generated by running:

```bash
python build.py rust
```

This will create a directory called rust.build containing the Rust source code.

Tests can then be run by moving into this folder and using cargo:

```bash
cd rust.build
cargo test
```
