# Python library

The quadraturerules Python library is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/quadraturerules/).
It can be installed by running:

```bash
python -m pip install quadraturerules
```

## Usage

The library's function `single_integral_quadrature` can be used to get the points and weights
of quadrature rules for a single integral. For example the following snippet will create an
order 3 Xiao--Gimbutas rule on a triangle:

```python
from quadraturerules import Domain, QuadratureRule, single_integral_quadrature

points, weights = single_integral_quadrature(
    QuadratureRule.XiaoGimbutas,
    Domain.Triangle,
    3,
)
```

Note that the points returned by the library are represented using
[barycentric coordinates](/barycentric.md).

## Generating the library
The Python quadraturerules library can be generated from the templates in the online encyclopedia
of quadrature rules GitHub repo. First clone the repo and move into the library directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quadraturerules/quadraturerules.git
cd quadraturerules/library
```

The Python library can then be generated by running:

```bash
python build.py python
```

This will create a directory called python.build containing the Python source code.

Tests can then be run by moving into this folder and using pytest:

```bash
cd python.build
python -m pytest test/
```
